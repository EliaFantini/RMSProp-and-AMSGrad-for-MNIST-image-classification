Implementation of different first order (FO) stochastic methods: stochastic gradient descent (SGD), stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDw/Momentum) , Root Mean Squared Propagation (RMSProp), Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (Adagrad).  This project was made to test these different optimizers on a handwritten digit classifier using the well-known MNIST dataset. This dataset has 60000 training images, and 10000 test images. Each image is of size 28 Ã— 28 pixels, and shows a digit from 0 to 9.


For a more detailed explanation of the algorithms mentioned above, please read *Exercise instructions.pdf*, it contains also some theoretical questions answered in *Answers.pdf* (handwritten). 

The project was part of an assignment for the EPFL course [EE-556 Mathematics of data: from theory to computation](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/mathematics-of-data-from-theory-to-computation-EE-556). The backbone of the code structure to run the experiments was already given by the professor and his assistants, what I had to do was to implement the core theoretical concepts to actually make the experiments work. Hence, every code file is a combination of my personal code and the code that was given us by the professor.

The following table shows a summary of the training done by running **main.py** in the *code* folder.

The following image shows an example of the output figures of the code **main.py**. All plots show a comparison of convergence speed to the optimal loss and accuracy, for different learning rate's values.

## How to install and reproduce results
Download this repository as a zip file and extract it into a folder
The easiest way to run the code is to install Anaconda 3 distribution (available for Windows, macOS and Linux). To do so, follow the guidelines from the official
website (select python of version 3): https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Additional package required are: 
- matplotlib
- pytorch

To install them write the following command on Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3):
```shell
cd *THE_FOLDER_PATH_WHERE_YOU_DOWNLOADED_AND_EXTRACTED_THIS_REPOSITORY*
```
Then write for each of the mentioned packages:
```shell
conda install *PACKAGE_NAME*
```
Some packages might require more complex installation procedures (especially [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)). If the above command doesn't work for a package, just google "How to install *PACKAGE_NAME* on *YOUR_MACHINE'S_OS*" and follow those guides.

Finally, run **main.py**. 
```shell
python main.py
```
